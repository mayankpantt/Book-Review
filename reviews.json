    "title": "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo",
    "author": "Taylor Jenkins Reid",
    "review": "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid is an utterly captivating read that pulled me in from the first page. The story unfolds through the eyes of Evelyn Hugo, a glamorous and complex Hollywood icon who recounts her life and the seven marriages that defined her.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me most was how human and relatable Evelyn felt, despite her fame. Her journey through love, loss, and self-discovery resonated deeply with me. Reid's writing is both lush and sharp, effortlessly blending the glitz of old Hollywood with raw emotion and insight into identity and ambition.\r\n\r\nI loved how the narrative challenges societal norms around love and relationships, showing that they’re rarely straightforward. This book isn’t just about the husbands; it’s about Evelyn’s quest for herself amidst the chaos of her life. It’s a beautiful exploration of what it means to be a woman in a world that constantly tries to define you. This novel will stay with me long after finishing it—definitely a must-read!",
